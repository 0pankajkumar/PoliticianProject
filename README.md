# PoliticianProject
Tracking politicians &amp; rating them based on promises fulfilled

## The plan
1. Get the manifesto of targeted political person / party.
    * Divide the manifesto into tasks which is basic human manageble task. (eg: Supplying 24 hrs water supply to each home)
2. Set up a news tracker
    * Select news resources which provide news as RSS feeds or something directly consumable.
    * The sources have to be a media house covering all minor to major issues happening daily.
    * Decide upon the database architecture to store these news items & index them for fast skimming & searching to establish nearness to the promises.
3. Have a NLP based decision system to determine whether a promise has been fulfilled by skimming through news articles.
4. Decide a percentage or score to the promise based on how much it has been fulfilled.
5. Rank political person / party based on scores generated.
    * The task is to find the most efficient politician who walks the talk.
6. Rank selected political person / party on a web based dashboard.
7. Let this system continue on an automated fashion & refresh scores based on latest news articles coming.


## The Beta phase
Past period manifesto will be chosen which is old enough so that enough news articles are already accumulated. This will help in quick testing of the model & correcting wrong logic as soon as encountered.
